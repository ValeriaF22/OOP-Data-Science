# OOP-Data-Science
Object Oriented Programming for Data Science with Python

The goal of this project is to use Object Oriented Programming for Data Science with Python. 
The “Loan Prediction with 3 Problem Statement” dataset from kaggle is used for this project. 
There are three csv files with data for training, test and test targets. 
This problem was treated as a classification problem, trying to predict whether the loan candidate was applicable to get a loan or not. 
Additionally, OOP is used as a programming paradigm, therefore four classes were created:

1. ExploratoryDataAnalysis Class

2. PreProcessing Class

3. Processing Class

4. MachineLearning Class
